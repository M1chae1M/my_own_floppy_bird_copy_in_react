My Flappy Bird Read.me

    Program is a game inspired by "Flappy Bird".
    Created from scratch using react, html and css.
    The game runs in 4 states (before start, game started, dead, dead but with the ability to enter the scoreboard).
    In order to enter the scoreboard, you need to get a score in the top 10, or play a match when there are less than 10 records entered.
    Press "space" key to jump.
    It was my first ambitious project written with react.
